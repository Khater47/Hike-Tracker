  - Hours spent on remediation : 6h
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability"): 0.0%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ) :
    - Reliability : A
    - Maintainability : A
    - Security : A

### SonarQube strategy

The team has decided to use the following strategy:

- Fixing all the critical security issues
- Fixing as many code smells as possible :

  Since this project has thousands of lines of code, we wanted to make sure that all the best practices were adopted, so that in the future, we will have clearer and easier code to maintain.
  Some code smells have also been marked as resolved, as we felt that the code written did not violate any best practice in terms of maintainability.

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - /

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - As a team, we have learned how to use SonarQube in order to check the quality of our code, how to fix the issues that it reports, and the best practices that we should follow. We don't have any negative lessons to report.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - We were able to achieve all the planned goals, set in the previous retrospective. As a matter of fact, by completing the tasks two days before the deadline, we were able to focus on the quality of our code, by fixing bugs and issues reported by SonarQube and not.

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - /

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - **Increase productivity**: Having reached the fourth sprint, we believe we have improved a lot in the management of the assigned time and in the knowledge of the technologies used on the project. For this reason we want to try to improve our productivity by trying to commit one more story than in the previous sprint or trying to complete the same number of stories but with more points.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - As a team, we are proud of the fact that we have been able to complete all the tasks assigned to us, and that we have been able to fix all the important issues reported by SonarQube. We are also proud of the fact that we have been able to complete the tasks two days before the deadline, and that we have been able to focus on the quality of our code.
