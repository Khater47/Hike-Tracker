TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 18)
====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: __3 vs 2__
- Total points committed vs. done: __29 vs 21__
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): __72h / 73h 05m__

  We needed 1h 05m more than the planned hours to help who needed help and to fix some code bugs.

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  - estimate hours per task average: 2.83
  - estimate standard deviation: 3.12
  - actual hours per task average: 3.20
  - actual standard deviation: 3.24
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: -0,116

The total task estimation error ratio is negative because the number of hours spent is greater than the number of hours estimated.

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 6h
  - Total hours spent: 7h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 34
  - Coverage (if available): 99%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 4h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 4h 15m

- Code review (front-end and back-end)
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 2h

## ASSESSMENT

- **What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?**

  We didn't realize we have some problems regarding knowledge of some technology we used and there were some aspects we didn't think we need, so we had to add more tasks during the sprint.

- **What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?**

  We learn that the more the number of people working on the same project, the more difficult is to organize work.

  However it is nice to have someone that can help you whenever you need.
- **Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?**

  This is our first retrospective, so we didn't have any goals.
- **Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?**

  For the same reason of the previous answer we didn't have anything to achieve.
- **Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)**

  - **More coordination**: in addition to the daily scrum use a tool(like Notion) where each team member for each shared task is able to write comments and communications.
  - **Better task assignation and estimation**

- **One thing you are proud of as a Team!!**

  We are proud of the fact that togheter we have been able to help each other and have also been able to be more cohesive and organized among difficulties.
