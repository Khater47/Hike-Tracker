TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 18)
====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: **2** __vs 2__
- Total points committed vs. done: __29 vs 29__
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): __72h / 74h 50m__

  We needed 2h 30m more than the planned hours because some tasks required more time spent.

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  - estimate hours per task average: 2.04
  - estimate standard deviation: 2.01
  - actual hours per task average: 2.12
  - actual standard deviation: 2.18
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: -0,0377

The total task estimation error ratio is negative because the number of hours spent is greater than the number of hours estimated.

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:

  - Total hours estimated: 4h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 4h 30m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 67
  - Coverage (if available): 99%
- E2E testing:

  - Total hours estimated: 1h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 1h 30m
- Code review (front-end and back-end)

  - Total hours estimated: 2h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 2h 30m

## ASSESSMENT

- **What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?**

  - We underestimated the time needed to implement the registration form and the time needed to implement the municipality filter. We spent also some time to fix code bugs.
- **What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?**

  - We learnt that committing less stories let us work better and in a more precise way.
  - We learnt that unfortunately team members have different time slots to work in and then, organizing activities in terms of parallelized work is more difficult.
- **Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?**

  - We were able to achieve all the planned goals set in the previous retrospective. By committing less stories,in fact, we were able to manage better the quality of our work.
- **Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?**

  - /
- **Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)**

  - **Better work organization**: we will try to complete all the tasks assigned to a specific sprint at least 2 days before the sprint ends.
  - Although we were able to achieve all the goals set in the previous retrospective, we still need to improve a little bit in task estimation.
- **One thing you are proud of as a Team!!**

  - We are proud of the fact that members specialized in particular features make themselves available to everyone else  to explain them well.
