TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 18)
====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done:  __2 vs 2__
- Total points committed vs. done: __29 vs 29__
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): __72h / 74h 50m__

  We needed 2h 50m more than the planned hours because some tasks required more time spent.

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

## QUALITY MEASURES

  - Total hours spent: 4h 30m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 67
  - Coverage (if available): 99%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 1h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 1h 30m
- Code review (front-end and back-end)
  - Total hours estimated: 2h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 2h 30m

## ASSESSMENT

- **What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?**

  - We underestimated the time needed to implement the registration form and the time needed to implement the municipalities filter. We spent also some time to fix code bugs that we didn't expected.

- **What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?**

  - We learnt that committing less stories let us work better and in a more precise way.
  - We learnt that unfortunately team members have different ways of working and different time slots to work in and then, organizing activities in terms of parallelized work is more difficult.

- **Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?**

  - We were able to achieve all the planned goals set in the previous retrospective. As a matter of fact, even though we still spent a bit more time on some tasks, by  committing less stories we were able to manage better the quality of our work.

- **Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?**

  - /

- **Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)**

  - **Better work organization**: we will try to complete all the tasks assigned to a specific sprint at least 1 / 2 days before the sprint ends. This will allow us to have more time to fix eventual bugs and to improve the quality of our work.

- **One thing you are proud of as a Team!!**

  - We are proud of the fact that members specialized in particular features make themselves available to everyone else to explain and let them now how to work better on those aspects.
